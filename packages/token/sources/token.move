/// This is an implementation approach for Closed-Loop Tokens. The idea behind it is that the token
/// behaves like a coin but is not freely available, and every action with this coin is permissioned.
///
/// The rules applied to the token are defined by the token issuer and include:
///
/// - mint / burn
/// - transfer
/// - split
/// - merge
/// - spend (merge with a shared balance)
/// - shared balance
/// - convert to Coin
/// - convert from Coin
///
/// The Sui Framework already has a Balance<T> primitive which seems like the best base to utilize
/// for an experiment like this. Supply<T> will control the supply, however, in this implemntation
/// we will use some practices that may not be ideal under different circumstances, such as issuing
/// multiple supplies.
///
/// Another important side of the approach is it being similar to the TransferPolicy implementation
/// that makes Kiosk trades secure and approvable by the creator always. Utilizing Hot Potato to
/// guarantee that every action is protected and approved by the issuer is a decent pattern.
///
/// Notes:
///
/// - We can't use OTW for the purpose to give space to Publisher.
/// - We will intentionally utilize multiple `Supply`s to allow multiple policies.
/// - CL stands for Closed-Loop.
/// - We're using TempToken to abstract away from ownership.
