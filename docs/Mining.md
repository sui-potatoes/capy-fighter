# Mining and Randomness sources

It is possible to create a closed ecosystem for mining and randomness sources.
Admin of the game can establish the "pools" or "beacons" which miners can hit
and produce the randomness by bumping the hash stored inside the pool.

For each "bump" operation, miners get a reward which is added to the balance of
the miner. The reward is fixed and ideally should be spread among all miners
using some diversity algorithm. The in-game currency can be owned but cannot be
merged nor transferred. Three things that can happen with the rewards are:

1. Using in the game to buy some items or services.
2. Get the reward in the form of the in-game currency for mining actions.
3. Burn the reward and the account completely to get the storage rebate.

The pt.2 is the toughest to get right. While the currency itself can't be used
for trading or liquidity pools, the items purchased for the currency are
tradable and that implicitly exposes the currency to the market.
