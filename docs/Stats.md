# Stats for fighters

Each fighter has a set of stats that determine how they perform in battle. Stats
are assigned only once at the beginning of the game based on the genes of the
SuiFren. The stats are mocking the Pokemon ones:

- HP - health points
- ATK - attack - defines the power of physical attacks
- DEF - defense - defines the resistance to physical attacks
- SPD - speed - defines the order of the moves
- SATK - special attack - defines the power of special attacks
- SDEF - special defense - defines the resistance to special attacks

Each Capy can receive one of the 8 classes, each class has at least one and at
most two special stats. The class is determined by the genes of the SuiFren and
cannot be changed.
